# SDL Game Loop Boilerplate

This repository contains a boilerplate for developing a game loop using C and the SDL library. The boilerplate provides a solid foundation for starting a game project and covers various essential aspects such as setting up the development environment on different platforms, creating an SDL window, handling process input, and rendering basic shapes.

The boilerplate demonstrates the management of framerates and ensures smooth movement of game objects based on delta-time. Additionally, it showcases the use of Makefiles to streamline the build process and provides guidance on structuring code in a maintainable and scalable manner.

This SDL game loop boilerplate aims to serve as a starting point for developers looking to create more complex game projects using C and SDL.

## Getting Started

To get started with the boilerplate, follow these steps:

1 Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ryanzola/sdl-game-loop-boilerplate.git
cd sdl-game-loop-boilerplate
```

2 Ensure that you have SDL2 installed on your system. If not, follow the instructions in the video or refer to the official SDL documentation for installation guidance.

3 Utilize the provided Makefile to build, run, and clean the project:

- Build the project:

```bash
make build
```

- Run the project:

```bash
make run
```

- Clean the project (remove the compiled binary):

```bash
make clean
```

After following these steps, you should have a running instance of the boilerplate, which you can then modify and expand upon to create your game project.
